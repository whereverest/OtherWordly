You can usually make a comparative by adding er to the end of an adjective.: music is louder than silence.: An elephant is bigger than a mouse.A superlative compares one thing to a group of similar things. You can usually make a superlative by adding est to the end of an adjective.: The savannah elephant is the largest type of elephant.: Rock music is the loudest type of music.Often, the group of other things is not said:: Rock music is the loudest.If the adjective ends in an &quot;e&quot;, then just -r or -st is added.: nice - nicer - nicest.If adding an &quot;e&quot; to the end of the word will change the sound of the word, then the consonant is doubled. This happens when the last three letters of the adjective are a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant.: big - bigger - biggest.: hot - hotter - hottest.A few common adjectives have irregular comparatives and superlatives:: good - better - best: bad - worse - worstte:Appendix/Adjective

§Wiktionary:Deletion
	¶Abbreviations are sometimes used when talking about these rules. For example, when someone says &quot;A4&quot;, they are referring to rule 4 under the articles section.
		#Nonsense includes content that does not make sense or is not meaningful. However, this does not include bad writing, bad words, vandalism, things that are fake or impossible, or parts not in English.
		#Test pages such as &quot;Can I really create a page here?&quot;.
		#Only vandalism, including redirects that were made when cleaning up page move vandalism.
		#Creation of content that was already deleted. An identical or similar copy, with any title, of a page that was deleted after being discussed in Requests for deletion, unless it was undeleted due to another discussion or was recreated in the user space. Before deleting again, the administrator should be sure that the content is similar and not just a new article on the same subject. However, this rule cannot be used if the content had already been quickly deleted before. 
		#Banned user. Pages created by banned users while they were banned.
		#Housekeeping. A deletion that doesn't need to be discussed because the administrator deleting the page was trying to fix an accidental mistake or trying to clean up something.
		#Author wants deletion. Any page whose original author wants deletion, but only if most of the page was written by that author and was created as a mistake. If the author blanks the page, this might mean that he or she wants it deleted.
		#Talk pages of pages that do not exist, unless they contain discussion on deletion that can't be found anywhere else. Subpages of talk pages can only be deleted under this rule if its top-level page does not exist. However, this cannot be used on user talk pages or talk pages of images on Commons.
		#Office action. The Wikimedia Foundation office can delete any page quickly if there is any controversy over it.
		#Attack pages. Pages that were only created to insult a person or thing (such as &quot;John Q. Doe is dumb&quot;). &lt;!-- this is an example of an attack page, not of patent nonsense; please don't reword to make it silly --&gt; This includes pages about a living person that are insulting, where there is no version in the history that is not insulting.
		#Obvious advertising. Pages which were created only to say good things about a company, item, group or service and which would need to be written again so that it can sound like a dictionary entry. However, simply having a company, item, group or service as its subject does not mean that an article can be deleted because of this rule: an article that is obvious advertising should have content that shouldn't be in a dictionary as well. If a page has already gone through RfD or QD and was not deleted, it should not be quickly deleted using this rule. 
		#Obviously breaking copyright law such as if it was:
		#Very short articles providing little or no meaning (e.g., &quot;He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great.&quot;). Having a small amount of content is not a reason to delete if it has useful information. 
		#No content. Any article consisting only of links elsewhere (including hyperlinks, category tags and &quot;see also&quot; sections), a rephrasing of the title, and/or attempts to correspond with the person or group named by its title. This does not include disambiguation pages.
		#Transwikied articles. Any article that has been discussed at Requests for Deletion, where most of the users wanted to transwiki, and where the transwikification has already been done. 
		#People, groups, companies or websites that are not notable. An article about a real person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content that does not say why it is important. If not everyone agrees that the subject is not notable or there has been a previous RfD, the article should be discussed at RfD instead. Note: Avoid the use of the word &quot;vanity&quot; as some people think it is an insult.
		#Redirects to pages that do not exist
		#Redirects to the User: or User_talk: space from the main article space. If this was because of a page move, please wait a day or two before deleting the redirect.
		#Redirects with an uncommon typo that were recently created. However, redirects from common accidental spellings are usually useful; redirects in other languages are not deletable using this rule.
		#Empty categories (with no articles or subcategories for at least four days) whose only content includes links to parent categories. However, this can not be used on categories still being discussed on disambiguation categories. If the category wasn't newly made, it is possible that it used to have articles, and more inspection is needed. 
		#Speedy renaming. Empty categories that have already been renamed. This include:
		#Spelling fixes (such as Brdiges -&gt; Bridges), but not changes between British and American spelling.
		#Capitalization fixes (such as characters In harry Potter -&gt; Characters in Harry Potter)
		#Changing singular words to plural or plural words to singular ones (such as Steamship -&gt; Steamships)
		#Renaming of a title so that it has the &quot;by country&quot; standard 
		#Renaming of a title so it has no abbreviations
		#Template categories. If a category contains articles from only one template (such as :Category:Cleanup needed from ) and the template is deleted after being discussed, the category can also be deleted without being discussed as well.
